### Details

The goal of this repository is to compile OpenGL programs I have written and I find worth sharing. This includes programs I used to generate results of technical papers I have published, or written just for fun :)

### Licence

Apart from the submodule folder, the code from this repository is released in public domain.

### Cloning

Clone the repository and all its submodules using the following command:
```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:jdupuy/opengl-framework.git
```

If you accidentally omitted the `--recursive` flag when cloning the repository you can retrieve the submodules like so:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
